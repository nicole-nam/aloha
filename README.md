This is my Aloha project...

Objective:

Technologies Used:

HTML

Personal Learnings:
Learned how to implement a mobile-first, responsive layout using flexbox. Used external sources such as Flickity and Font Awesome and linked them to index.html file so that they are accessible in Visual Studio Code. Learned how to use Visual Studio Code, and developer tools. Backed up files to Github using terminal commands. Started to use javascript language for the first time and added some functionality to the website. 

Installation Instructions:
This website does not have a domain, it is only a mock-up version of Aloha Apparel. Please download the files that are uploaded in Github in order to interact with the pages.
